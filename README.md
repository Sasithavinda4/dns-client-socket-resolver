# dns-client-socket-resolver
A simple Python socket-based DNS client that constructs and sends RFC-compliant DNS query messages to a specified DNS server to resolve the IP address of a given URL. The client accepts a DNS server IP and a URL as input, sends the query over UDP, and prints the resolved IP address from the response.
